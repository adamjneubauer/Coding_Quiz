### Coding Quiz

### Description
The goal of this project is to create a webpage that contains a multiple choice quiz which tests the user's knowledge of basic computer science questions with 5 questions. The site will track and display the user's score and store the highest score achieved on the test. The quiz contains a two-minute timer that ends the quiz once it reaches 0. The user may take the quiz as many times as he or she wants.
